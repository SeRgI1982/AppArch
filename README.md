# AppArch
AppArch presents my way of thinking about application architecture. I will try to show how I use things like: CQRS, DDD, Service Bus (RabbitMQ), NoSQL (MongoDB), MVVM an other SOLID principles.  My goal: deliver a set of client apps (desktop - WPF, web - ASP.NET MVC, mobile - Xamarin) which communicate with the same back-end and are able to notify each other.
